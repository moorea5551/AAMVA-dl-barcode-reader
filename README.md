# AAMVA-dl-barcode-reader
Searches and reads PDF417 barcodes on the back of the AAMVA drivers license.

Currently prints a subset of datapoints (first, middle, last name) but I left in commented out data points with their respective field IDs.  These might not be fully accurate and need vetting based on the input field array.
